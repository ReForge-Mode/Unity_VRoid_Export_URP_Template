# Unity VRoid Import to URP Template
This project is a ready-to-use URP template with UniVRM plugin and URP MToon Shader already installed. This project uses Unity version 2021.2.3f, earlier versions of Unity might not work and later versions might break some of the scripts. I made this publicly available because some people have reported in my video comment section that they are unable to get the UniVRM plugin to install properly.

Huge credit to these guys who made this possible!

# Instructions

This project uses Unity version 2021.2.3f, earlier versions of Unity might not work and later versions might break some of the scripts. To download a specific version of Unity, go to this website https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive. After you download and install the Unity version, you can add this version of Unity back to Unity Hub and open it.

When you first open this project, Unity will generate all necessary files. it could take a while, so relax, play your favorite song, and grab a coffee or tea! Once it's opened in Unity and it looks exactly like in the screenshot, you're all set!
